# The-Book-Shelf
The Bookshelf is a web application that acts as a real-world bookshelf along with some additional features. Any user can log in and add a post about the ratings and content of the book he/she liked to the entire collection of books. The user after logging in can also edit his/her previous posts and also look at all his/her posts in one place. For the users who donâ€™t wish to contribute to the collection and just wish to refer the posts of the other users need not log in. The entire collection of posts is displayed on the home page itself.
Thus this application is one stop for all the bookworms who are looking for some quick suggestion to choose their next book.
